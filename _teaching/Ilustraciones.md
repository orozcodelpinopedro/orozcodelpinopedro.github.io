When the pandemic started I started to spend a lot of time with my kids. All kids have moments you don't want to forget. Me and Mariana had been writting their moments since my oldest was a few months old. But some of their moments are hard to describe (at least for me) with only words. That is why I decided to start making cartoons about them. I had no idea what I was doing, I still don't. But it has bring joy to me and my extended family. This has become a big part of me and I want to share it with whomever is interested. Maybe inspire someone to try it for themselves.
