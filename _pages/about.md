I am Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Biostatistics at the University of Michigan](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/). I work with [Dr Zöllner](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/zollner-sebastian.html) in statistical genetics, and with [Dr Boonstra](https://sph.umich.edu/faculty-profiles/boonstra-philip.html) in data integration methods. I am a former [Fulbright-García Robles fellow](https://www.comexus.org.mx) (September 2017 until August 2020), which help me support myself during the first three years of my Ph.D.

I am also one of the co-founders of "[Mexicanos en Estadística y Salud](https://mxciencia.github.io)," a group of Mexican researchers who does science communication. 

Before, I completed a MS in the Department of Statistics at the [Center for Research in Mathematics (CIMAT)](https://www.cimat.mx), advised by [Professor Miguel Nakamura](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Miguel-Nakamura). I received a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics from the [Mexico Autonomous Institute of Technology (ITAM)](http://departamentodematematicas.itam.mx/es), where I did my thesis with [Professor Luis Enrique Nieto Barajas](http://allman.rhon.itam.mx/%7Elnieto/index.html).

I moved from Mexico City to Ann Arbor in 2017 and we live there with our three kids since then. In my free time I draw to capture my kids in their best, come check it out [here](https://express.adobe.com/page/5RXH0SuLILZ7Z/).

I am always happy to connect with people from all stages of their careers about [collaborations](https://orozcodelpinopedro.github.io/portfolio/ind), networking, or mentoring. Please shoot me an [email](mailto:porozco@umich.edu) anytime!
